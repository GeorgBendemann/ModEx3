Firstly, [Exercise 0](#Exercise0) provides an overview of the here used methods to access the `geant4_simulation` package which provides a user-friendly and quick frontend to the underlying `Geant4` framework. For any in-depth questions about the presented methods, do not be afraid of checking the `geant4_simulation` code. Secondly, [Exercise 1](#Exercise1) discusses in a lightweight fashion the interaction of photons and electrons with matter. Subsequently, [Exercise 2](#Exercise2) studies in-depth the generation and properties of electromagnetic showers. [Exercise 3](#Exercise3) performs a simplified calibration to connect a measured detector readout to the observed deposited energy of photons. "

    "In the lectures two specialised calorimeter concepts with the common task of measuring the energy of incoming particles were introduced.\n",
    "The distinction between these two types is often made because of the respective challenges they face:\n",
    "- Electromagnetic calorimeters are primarily optimised to measure as precisely as possible the energy of photons and electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercises, you were already made familiar with the basic concepts of this type of shower.\n",
    "The other type of calorimeters, namely hadron calorimeters, specials on dealing with hadronic showers.\n",
    "The key differences for hadronic showers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The hadronic interaction length is much larger than the radiation length of photons and electrons.\n",
    "- Hadronic showers consist to about a third of neutral pions that decay into two photons.\n",
    "- Lastly, hadronic showers contain a large fraction (20-40%) of \"invisible\" particles which reduces the possible energy resolution in comparison to electromagnetic calorimeters. \n",

    "Another design choice for calorimeters is (are) the used material(s). A first-order distinction can be made for the homogenous and sampling calorimeter:\n",
    "- **Sampling calorimeter** <br>\n",
    "    Sampling calorimeters have a layered structure with alternating layers of absorber (passive) and detector (active) material.\n",
    "    On the one hand, the design and material choice are flexible and optimisable to a specific task or financial budget.\n",
    "    On the other hand, some of the energy is deposited in the absorber which limits the energy resolution.\n",
    "- **Homogenous calorimeter** <br>\n",
    "    Here, one material is used simultaneously as an absorber and active material.\n",
    "    Consequently, all the energy is deposited in the detector which allows for an optimal energy resolution.\n",
    "    Also, the choice of the material can be specialised to the task, e.g. CsI has a very low light yield but allows for fast readout; CsI(Tl) has high light yield but slow readout. \n",
    "    However, the materials capable of this task (mostly scintillator crystals) are custom made which makes them often very expensive and very heavy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The following exercises will focus on a sampling calorimeter structure with lead absorbers and liquid argon as active material.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of calorimeters is the readout of the detector which determines the measured energy of the particle.\n",
    "As discussed in the lecture the total number of particles in an electromagnetic shower is proportional to the initial energy of the particle.\n",
    "One very common use case in high-energy particle experiments is the use of scintillation materials.\n",
    "In this case, the electromagnetic shower leads to the production of photons in the visible spectrum which can be measured by photo multipliers, photo diodes, etc.\n",
    "For example, the voltage measured at a silicon photomultiplier is proportional to the number of incoming photons which in turn is proportional to the initial energy.\n",
    "The following exercises will discuss a closely related measurement principle: The count of charged particles in the active material."
